\value{
A numeric value representing P(T1 - T2 > q), the probability that the difference
between the two t-distributed variables exceeds the quantile q.
}
\description{
This function calculates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the difference
between two independent t-distributed random variables using the Integrated Nested Laplace
Approximation (INLA) with power prior for external data. Specifically, it computes
P(T1 - T2 > q) where T1 and T2 follow t-distributions estimated from current and external data.
}
\details{
This function uses the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to estimate posterior
distributions when external data are available. The method involves:
\itemize{
\item Incorporating external data through power priors with scaling parameters α01 and α02
\item Using INLA for fast approximate Bayesian inference
\item Generating posterior samples to compute the probability of interest
\item Supporting flexible combinations of external treatment and/or control data
}

The power prior approach allows borrowing strength from historical data while controlling
the degree of borrowing through the power parameters. INLA provides computationally efficient
approximations compared to full MCMC approaches.
