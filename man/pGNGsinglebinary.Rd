\arguments{
\item{prob}{A character string specifying the type of probability to use for
decision-making. Options are \code{'posterior'} for posterior probability
or \code{'predictive'} for posterior predictive probability.}

\item{design}{A character string specifying the type of trial design. Options are
\code{'controlled'} for randomized controlled trials, \code{'uncontrolled'}
for single-arm studies, or \code{'external'} for designs incorporating
external data.}

\item{theta.TV}{A numeric value representing the target value threshold for
calculating Go probability when \code{prob = 'posterior'}. This represents
the minimum clinically meaningful treatment effect.}

\item{theta.MAV}{A numeric value representing the minimum acceptable value threshold
for calculating NoGo probability when \code{prob = 'posterior'}. This represents
the futility threshold.}

\item{theta.NULL}{A numeric value representing the null hypothesis threshold for
calculating Go/NoGo probabilities when \code{prob = 'predictive'}.}

\item{gamma1}{A numeric value in (0, 1) representing the minimum probability
threshold to declare success (Go decision). Typically set to values like
0.8 or 0.9.}

\item{gamma2}{A numeric value in (0, 1) representing the maximum probability
threshold for declaring futility (NoGo decision). Typically set to values
like 0.2 or 0.3, with gamma2 < gamma1.}

\item{pi1}{A numeric value or vector representing the true response probability(s)
for group 1 (treatment) under which to evaluate operating characteristics.}

\item{pi2}{A numeric value or vector representing the true response probability(s)
for group 2 (control) under which to evaluate operating characteristics.}

\item{n1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1 for
the proof-of-concept (PoC) trial.}

\item{n2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2 for
the PoC trial.}

\item{a1}{A positive numeric value representing the first shape parameter (α)
of the prior beta distribution for group 1.}

\item{a2}{A positive numeric value representing the first shape parameter (α)
of the prior beta distribution for group 2.}

\item{b1}{A positive numeric value representing the second shape parameter (β)
of the prior beta distribution for group 1.}

\item{b2}{A positive numeric value representing the second shape parameter (β)
of the prior beta distribution for group 2.}

\item{z}{A non-negative integer representing the hypothetical observed number
of responders in group 2 for an uncontrolled design (required if
\code{design = 'uncontrolled'}).}

\item{m1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1 for
the future trial (required if \code{prob = 'predictive'}).}

\item{m2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2 for
the future trial (required if \code{prob = 'predictive'}).}

\item{ne1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1 for
the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}).}

\item{ne2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2 for
the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}).}

\item{ye1}{A non-negative integer representing the observed number of responders
in group 1 for the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}).}

\item{ye2}{A non-negative integer representing the observed number of responders
in group 2 for the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}).}

\item{ae1}{A numeric value in (0, 1] representing the power prior scale parameter
for group 1 (required if \code{design = 'external'}). Controls the degree
of borrowing: 0 = no borrowing, 1 = full borrowing.}

\item{ae2}{A numeric value in (0, 1] representing the power prior scale parameter
for group 2 (required if \code{design = 'external'}). Controls the degree
of borrowing: 0 = no borrowing, 1 = full borrowing.}

\item{Gray_inc_Miss}{A logical value; if TRUE, Miss probability is included in
Gray probability. If FALSE, Miss probability is reported separately.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the true response probabilities for both groups
and the corresponding Go, NoGo, Gray, and Miss probabilities.

\description{
This function calculates the Go, NoGo, and Gray probabilities for binary outcome
clinical trials using the Bayesian framework. The function evaluates operating
characteristics by computing the probability of making each type of decision
(Go, NoGo, or Gray) across different true response rates. The function supports
controlled, uncontrolled, and external control designs.
}
\details{
The function evaluates operating characteristics by:
\itemize{
\item Enumerating all possible trial outcomes (y1, y2) under the specified
true response rates (pi1, pi2)
\item Computing the posterior or predictive probability for each outcome
\item Classifying each outcome as Go, NoGo, or Gray based on decision thresholds
\item Weighting each outcome by its probability under the true response rates
}

\strong{Decision rules}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Go}: P(treatment effect > threshold | data) ≥ γ₁ AND
P(treatment effect > threshold | data) in lower tail < γ₂
\item \strong{NoGo}: P(treatment effect > threshold | data) < γ₁ AND
P(treatment effect > threshold | data) in lower tail ≥ γ₂
\item \strong{Gray}: Neither Go nor NoGo criteria are met (γ₂ < probability < γ₁)
\item \strong{Miss}: Both Go and NoGo criteria are met simultaneously (indicates
poorly chosen thresholds)
}

The function can be used for:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Controlled design}: Two-arm randomized trial
\item \strong{Uncontrolled design}: Single-arm trial with historical control
\item \strong{External design}: Incorporating historical data through power priors
}
