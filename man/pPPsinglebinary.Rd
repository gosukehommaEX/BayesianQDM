\arguments{
\item{prob}{A character string specifying the type of probability to calculate.
Options are \code{'posterior'} for posterior probability or \code{'predictive'}
for posterior predictive probability.}

\item{design}{A character string specifying the type of trial design. Options are
\code{'controlled'} for randomized controlled trials, \code{'uncontrolled'}
for single-arm studies, or \code{'external'} for designs incorporating external data.}

\item{theta0}{A numeric value representing the pre-specified threshold value for
the treatment effect (difference in response rates).}

\item{n1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1
(treatment) for the proof-of-concept (PoC) trial.}

\item{n2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2.
For \code{design = 'controlled'} or \code{'external'}: sample size of the
control group. For \code{design = 'uncontrolled'}: hypothetical control
sample size (typically set equal to n1).}

\item{y1}{A non-negative integer representing the observed number of responders
in group 1 for the PoC trial (must satisfy 0 ≤ y1 ≤ n1).}

\item{y2}{A non-negative integer representing the number of responders in group 2.
For \code{design = 'controlled'} or \code{'external'}: observed number of
responders in the control group (must satisfy 0 ≤ y2 ≤ n2).
For \code{design = 'uncontrolled'}: hypothetical control responder count
based on historical data or prior knowledge. This is mathematically equivalent
to the \code{z} parameter used in pGNGsinglebinary().}

\item{a1}{A positive numeric value representing the first shape parameter (α)
of the prior beta distribution for group 1.}

\item{a2}{A positive numeric value representing the first shape parameter (α)
of the prior beta distribution for group 2 (control or hypothetical control).}

\item{b1}{A positive numeric value representing the second shape parameter (β)
of the prior beta distribution for group 1.}

\item{b2}{A positive numeric value representing the second shape parameter (β)
of the prior beta distribution for group 2 (control or hypothetical control).}

\item{m1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1 for
the future trial (required if \code{prob = 'predictive'}, otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{m2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2 for
the future trial (required if \code{prob = 'predictive'}, otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{ne1}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 1 for
the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}, otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{ne2}{A positive integer representing the number of patients in group 2 for
the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'}, otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{ye1}{A non-negative integer representing the observed number of responders
in group 1 for the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'},
otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{ye2}{A non-negative integer representing the observed number of responders
in group 2 for the external data (required if \code{design = 'external'},
otherwise set to NULL).}

\item{ae1}{A numeric value in (0, 1] representing the power prior scale parameter
for group 1 (required if \code{design = 'external'}, otherwise set to NULL).
Controls the degree of borrowing: 0 = no borrowing, 1 = full borrowing.}

\item{ae2}{A numeric value in (0, 1] representing the power prior scale parameter
for group 2 (required if \code{design = 'external'}, otherwise set to NULL).
Controls the degree of borrowing: 0 = no borrowing, 1 = full borrowing.}

\item{lower.tail}{A logical value; if TRUE (default), probabilities are
P(treatment effect ≤ theta0), otherwise P(treatment effect > theta0).}
}
\value{
A numeric value in \code{[0, 1]} representing the Bayesian posterior probability
or posterior predictive probability that the treatment effect exceeds
(or is below) the threshold theta0.
}
\description{
This function computes Bayesian posterior probability or posterior predictive
probability for binary outcome clinical trials. The function supports controlled,
uncontrolled, and external control designs, using beta-binomial conjugate priors.
External data can be incorporated through power priors.
}
\details{
The function computes probabilities based on beta-binomial conjugate analysis:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Prior}: The proportion of responders (πj) for each group (j = 1, 2)
follows a beta distribution: πj ~ Beta(aj, bj)
\item \strong{Posterior}: After observing data, the posterior distribution is also
beta: πj | yj ~ Beta(aj + yj, bj + nj - yj)
\item \strong{Posterior predictive}: The predictive distribution of future trial
data follows a beta-binomial distribution
}

\strong{Design-specific handling}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Controlled design}: Uses observed control data (y2, n2) directly
\item \strong{Uncontrolled design}: Uses hypothetical control values (y2, n2) based on
historical data. The calculation is mathematically identical to controlled
design, but y2 represents an expected/hypothetical value rather than observed data.
\item \strong{External design}: Incorporates external data through power priors.
The effective prior becomes Beta(aj + aej × yej, bj + aej × (nej - yej)),
where aej controls the degree of borrowing.
}

\strong{Probability types}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Posterior probability}: P(π1 - π2 > theta0 | current data)
\item \strong{Posterior predictive probability}: P(future trial success | current data)
}
