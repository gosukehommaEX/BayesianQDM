## Package Summary

BayesianQDM provides comprehensive methods for Bayesian quantitative decision-making in clinical trials. The package supports both binary and continuous endpoints with various study designs including controlled, uncontrolled, and external control designs.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
* Go/NoGo/Gray decision probability calculations for clinical trials
* Posterior and posterior predictive probability computations
* Support for binary and continuous endpoints
* Multiple calculation methods (numerical integration, approximations, simulation)
* Power prior incorporation for external/historical data

### Study Designs
* Controlled trials (standard randomized designs)
* Uncontrolled trials (single-arm with historical controls)
* External control trials (incorporating historical data via power priors)

### Statistical Methods
* Beta-binomial modeling for binary endpoints
* Normal-inverse-chi-squared and vague priors for continuous endpoints
* Exact and approximate methods for t-distribution differences
* INLA integration for complex external data scenarios

## Documentation
* Three comprehensive vignettes with practical examples
* Complete function documentation with mathematical details
* Extensive test suite covering all core functionality

## Dependencies
* Imports: stats, INLA
* Suggests: testthat, knitr, rmarkdown
* All dependencies are well-established CRAN packages (INLA from separate repository)

## Performance Considerations
* Functions include computational method options (exact vs. approximate)
* Test suite and vignettes avoid computationally intensive methods (MC, INLA) for CRAN check speed
* Efficient implementations using vectorized operations where possible

## Backwards Compatibility
* This is an initial release, so no backwards compatibility concerns
* API designed for stability and extensibility

## Special Notes
* INLA package is suggested but not required - functions gracefully handle its absence
* Monte Carlo methods have adjustable iteration counts for performance tuning
* All numerical integration uses adaptive algorithms with appropriate tolerances
