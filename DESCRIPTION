Description: Provides comprehensive methods to calculate posterior probabilities, posterior predictive probabilities,
    and Go/NoGo/Gray probabilities for quantitative decision-making framework under Bayesian paradigm in clinical trials.
    The package supports both binary and continuous endpoints with controlled, uncontrolled, and external control designs.
    Multiple calculation methods are available including numerical integration, Monte Carlo simulation, 
    and Welch-Satterthwaite approximation for continuous outcomes. The framework enables evidence-based 
    decision making in proof-of-concept and phase II clinical trials using Bayesian statistical methods.
