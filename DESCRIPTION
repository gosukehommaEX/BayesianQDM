Description: Provides comprehensive methods to calculate posterior probabilities, posterior predictive probabilities,
    and Go/NoGo/Gray probabilities for quantitative decision-making framework under Bayesian paradigm in clinical trials.
    The package supports both binary and continuous endpoints with controlled, uncontrolled, and external control designs.
    For continuous outcomes, four calculation methods are available: numerical integration (NI), Monte Carlo simulation (MC), 
    Welch-Satterthwaite approximation (WS), and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). 
    The framework enables evidence-based decision making in proof-of-concept and phase II clinical trials using 
    Bayesian statistical methods with power priors for incorporating external or historical data.
