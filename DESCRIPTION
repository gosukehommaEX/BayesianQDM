Description: Provides comprehensive methods to calculate posterior probabilities, posterior predictive probabilities,
    and Go/NoGo/Gray probabilities for quantitative decision-making framework under Bayesian paradigm in clinical trials.
    The package supports both binary and continuous endpoints with controlled, uncontrolled, and external control designs.
    For continuous outcomes, three calculation methods are available: numerical integration (NI), Monte Carlo simulation (MC), 
    and Welch-Satterthwaite approximation (WS). For external control designs, power priors are incorporated using 
    exact conjugate representation as Normal-Inverse-Chi-squared distributions, enabling closed-form posterior computation 
    without MCMC sampling. This approach significantly reduces computational burden while preserving complete Bayesian rigor.
    The framework enables evidence-based decision making in proof-of-concept and phase II clinical trials using 
    Bayesian statistical methods with efficient power prior implementation for incorporating external or historical data.
